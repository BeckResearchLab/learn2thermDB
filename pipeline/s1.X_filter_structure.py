"""Script that labels putative protein pairs using 3D structures from AlphaFold and flexible alignment.

AlphaFold is a deep learning model that predicts protein 3D structures.
Flexible alignment is a technique used to compare the 3D structures of proteins.

This script queries 3D structures of proteins from AlphaFold and performs flexible alignment on the structures. It then
labels putative protein pairs with 3D alignment metrics.

Inputs to script:
-----------------
1 proteins in ./data/proteins in the form
  parquet files
2 parquet files at ./data/taxa_pairs/protein_alignment of the form "taxa_pair_XX-YY.parquet"
  Where XX and YY are the taxa ids of the two taxa in the pair. Contents are protein IDs and
  BLAST metics.

We must query AlphaFold for the 3D structure of proteins in the first input, then use the results to perform flexible alignment on protein pairs in the second input.

Outputs of script:
------------------
Parquet files at ./data/taxa_pairs/alphafold_val of the form "taxa_pair_XX-YY.parquet"
that are 1:1 mirrors of the taxa pair files, with 3D alignment metrics for each protein pair

Expected steps, approximately:
1. Load the protein sequences and associated taxonomic information from the input files
for DB version.
2. Query AlphaFold for the 3D structure of proteins.
3. Perform flexible alignment on the 3D structures pairs of proteins.
4. Save the resulting alignment metrics, including protein IDs in parquet files at
  ./data/taxa_pairs/alphafold_val of the form "taxa_pair_XX-YY.parquet", which are 1:1
  mirrors of the taxa pair files. Each parquet file should contain the 3D alignment metrics for each protein pair.
Make sure to handle errors and exceptions appropriately and document any assumptions or limitations of the script."""
