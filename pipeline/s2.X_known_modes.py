"""Compare observed protein pairs to concensus modes of thermal stability.

Eg. less amide AAs, percent of charged residues, etc.

Make bins of delta T pairs, look at T (other better for percent?) test between percentages as delta T changes.
Look for statistically significant differences between modes at each bin.
